an enhanced version of a number guess game

This is a version of the Higher Lower number guessing game that I am having difficultites with.
I am trying to create a prompt that continues loops if there is NaN or a decimal number (which I did figure out how to make it to continually loop for NaN but I couldn't figure it out for decimals. I am also having problems with how to prevent repeating numbers in an array of user-inputted numbers and how to prevent the repeating numbers and NaN from being included in a count.
